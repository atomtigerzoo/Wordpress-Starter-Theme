# Theme Init for Wordpress theme development

***

## Installation

- Clone (or download) this repository
- Edit `gulpfile.js` to match your development url and name
- Edit `bower.json` and `package.json` (project name, your details, etc)
- Run `npm install` to download and install all packages 
  (In some cases you will need to run `npm update` and `node rebuild node-sass` first)
- If everything went fine see *Gulp tasks* for development/build
- Develop your theme, install more npm or bower packages
- Be happy and contribute if you like


## Gulp tasks

There are three gulp tasks you can run:

- `gulp`
This will start browsersync, compiles your SASS, transpiles your JavaScript
and will then watch for changes in the /src directory and reload browsersync.

- `gulp clean`
This will clean your build folder if something went wrong after a build or if you
just wanted to test a build and keep it from your git.

- `gulp build`
This will copy everything from /src to /build, compiles SASS, transpiles JavaScript,
minify both CSS and JS, concatenate everything, bump the version number etc. 
Afterwards you can deploy/copy the /build folder or add it to your git tracking 
if you like.
